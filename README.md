    Synergy group
    Card type
    Card rating
    Synergy rating
  -Relic objects
    Relic name
    Synergy group
    Relic rating
    Synergy rating
  -Adjust weights every card selection/after combat
  -Form equation to give values of card choices
  -Make opencv/overlay to automatically update
 
-Future:
  -Create pathing program
  -Create combat program
  -Create money management program
  -Combine programs into sentient being that plays Slay the Spire so we don't have to
